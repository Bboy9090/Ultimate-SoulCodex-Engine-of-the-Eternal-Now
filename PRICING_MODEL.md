## Pricing Psychology

### Why This Pricing Works

**$9.99/Month:**
- Below $10 psychological threshold (feels affordable)
- Comparable to Netflix, Spotify, meditation apps ($8-$15/mo)
- Less than one coffee shop visit per week
- Positions as "premium but accessible"

**$89.99/Year:**
- 25% savings = strong incentive for commitment
- $7.49/month effective rate (even more affordable)
- Upfront payment improves cash flow
- Reduces churn (annual users less likely to cancel)

**7-Day Free Trial:**
- Low barrier to entry (just credit card)
- Enough time to experience full value (7 days > 3 days)
- Clear notifications prevent surprise charges
- Builds trust and reduces purchase anxiety

### Value Anchoring

**Free Tier is Generous:**
- Users can fully experience the core product
- Build trust before asking for payment
- Word-of-mouth marketing from satisfied free users

**Premium is Clear Upgrade:**
- 10x value for those who use app frequently
- Unlimited = no mental friction ("should I check compatibility again?")
- Advanced features justify the price (transits calendar, progressions worth $5-10 alone)

## Revenue Projections

### Assumptions
- 1,000 users by Month 6
- 5% conversion rate (50 paying users)
- 70% choose monthly, 30% choose annual

### Month 6 MRR Calculation
```
Monthly subscribers: 50 × 70% = 35 users × $9.99 = $349.65/mo
Annual subscribers: 50 × 30% = 15 users × $89.99 = $1,349.85 one-time
  Amortized MRR: $1,349.85 / 12 = $112.49/mo

Total MRR: $349.65 + $112.49 = $462.14/mo
Annual Run Rate (ARR): $462.14 × 12 = $5,545.68/year
```

### Year 1 Projections (Conservative)
| Month | Total Users | Paid Users (5%) | MRR | ARR |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|-----|-----|
| 1 | 100 | 5 | $46 | $552 |
| 3 | 300 | 15 | $138 | $1,656 |
| 6 | 1,000 | 50 | $462 | $5,544 |
| 9 | 2,500 | 125 | $1,155 | $13,860 |
| 12 | 5,000 | 250 | $2,310 | $27,720 |

**Notes:**
- Conversion rate may improve with optimization (targeting 7-10%)
- Churn rate assumed 5%/month (industry average)
- Lifetime Value (LTV) per premium user: ~$200-300 (2-3 years)
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) target: <$50 (organic growth + word-of-mouth)
