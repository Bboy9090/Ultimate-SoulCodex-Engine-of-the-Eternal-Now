# Soul Codex - Safety & Ethics Guidelines

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Status:** Mandatory Compliance  

---

## Overview

Soul Codex is committed to providing empowering, ethical, and safe personality and compatibility insights. This document establishes mandatory guidelines for all content, features, and communications to ensure we:

1. **Do no harm** - Avoid deterministic predictions that could damage relationships or self-esteem
2. **Empower, don't dictate** - Frame insights as possibilities and tendencies, not absolutes
3. **Respect boundaries** - Never provide medical, legal, or financial advice
4. **Protect users** - Implement safety measures for vulnerable users
5. **Be inclusive** - Use language that respects all identities, cultures, and beliefs

---

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Non-Determinism

**Principle:** We provide insights and possibilities, never absolute predictions or deterministic statements.

**Why:** Deterministic language can become self-fulfilling prophecies, limit user agency, or cause harm if "predictions" don't come true.

**Examples:**

❌ **BAD (Deterministic):**
- "You will meet your soulmate in 3 months"
- "This relationship is doomed to fail"
- "You are not compatible with Leos"
- "Your Saturn return will cause a divorce"
- "This compatibility score means you should break up"

✅ **GOOD (Empowering):**
- "This period may bring opportunities for meaningful connections"
- "This relationship has some challenging dynamics that require communication and effort"
- "Leo placements may present different perspectives—understanding these differences can strengthen connections"
- "Saturn returns often bring significant life restructuring; relationship changes are one possibility among many"
- "A lower compatibility score indicates areas that need more attention, not that the relationship can't work"

**Implementation:**
- Use modal verbs: "may", "might", "could", "tends to", "often"
- Frame as tendencies: "people with this placement often...", not "you will..."
- Emphasize user agency: "you have the power to...", "this awareness can help you..."
- Avoid absolutes: "always", "never", "definitely", "guaranteed"

---

### 2. Empowering Language

**Principle:** All insights should empower users to make informed decisions, not dictate what they should do.

**Why:** Users deserve autonomy. Our role is to illuminate, not control.

**Guidelines:**

**Growth-Oriented Framing:**
- Frame "challenges" as "growth opportunities"
- Frame "weaknesses" as "areas for development"
- Frame "incompatibility" as "differences to navigate"
- Frame "difficult transits" as "periods of transformation"

**User-Centric Language:**
- "You might find..." instead of "You are..."
- "This suggests..." instead of "This means..."
- "Consider..." instead of "You must..."
- "Your chart indicates..." instead of "You will..."

**Balanced Perspective:**
- Every "challenge" includes actionable advice
- Every "negative" aspect includes a positive reframe
- Every compatibility report includes both strengths and areas to work on
- No "doom and gloom" without context and support

**Examples:**

❌ **BAD (Disempowering):**
- "Your Venus square Mars means you'll have sexual problems"
- "You're too anxious-attached for healthy relationships"
- "Your low compatibility score means this won't work"
- "Saturn in your 7th house means late marriage or no marriage"

✅ **GOOD (Empowering):**
- "Venus square Mars can bring passionate tension. Awareness of this dynamic can help you channel that energy into deeper intimacy through open communication"
- "An anxious attachment style often develops from early experiences. With self-awareness and potentially professional support, you can build secure attachment patterns"
- "Your compatibility chart shows some differences. Understanding where you differ—and where you align—gives you tools to build a stronger relationship"
- "Saturn in the 7th house often brings serious, committed partnerships later in life, after important lessons about boundaries and self-worth. This placement can indicate stable, lasting relationships when timing is right"

### 3. No Medical Advice

**Principle:** Soul Codex is for entertainment, self-reflection, and personal growth—never a substitute for medical, psychiatric, or therapeutic care.

**Why:** We are not licensed medical professionals. Providing medical advice is illegal, unethical, and dangerous.

**Strict Rules:**

**Never Suggest:**
- Diagnoses of mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, ADHD, etc.)
- Diagnoses of physical health conditions (chronic illness, disease, etc.)
- Medical treatments or medications
- Alternatives to prescribed treatments
- Reasons to avoid medical care

**Always Refer Out:**
- If user asks about mental health → "For mental health concerns, please consult a licensed therapist or counselor"
- If user asks about physical health → "For health concerns, please consult a licensed medical professional"
- If user mentions self-harm or suicide → Display crisis resources immediately

**Disclaimers Required:**
- App footer: "For entertainment and self-reflection purposes only. Not a substitute for professional advice."
- AI chat initial message: "I provide cosmic insights for reflection, not medical, legal, or financial advice. For professional support, consult licensed experts."
- Profile creation: Checkbox "I understand this is for personal growth, not medical/psychological diagnosis"

**Crisis Resources:**

If AI detects self-harm, suicidal ideation, or severe mental health crisis language, automatically display:

```
It sounds like you're going through a difficult time. Please reach out to professionals who can help:

🇺🇸 US: National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988 or 1-800-273-8255
🌍 International: https://findahelpline.com/

Your safety matters. These services are free, confidential, and available 24/7.
```

**AI System Prompts:**
- Hard-coded instruction: "You are not a therapist, doctor, or medical professional. Never diagnose, treat, or provide medical advice. If user asks about mental/physical health, refer them to licensed professionals."
- Content filter: Block outputs containing diagnostic language (e.g., "you have depression", "you're bipolar", "this indicates PTSD")

---

### 4. No Legal or Financial Advice

**Principle:** We do not provide advice on legal matters, financial decisions, or career-specific actions that could have serious consequences.

**Why:** We lack legal/financial expertise, and incorrect advice could cause significant harm or liability.

**Out of Scope:**

❌ **Never Advise On:**
- Marriage or divorce decisions ("you should divorce him")
- Child custody or parenting legal matters
- Criminal legal matters
- Employment contracts or negotiations
- Investment decisions or stock picks
- Tax advice or financial planning
- Real estate transactions

✅ **Acceptable:**
- General timing guidance ("this period may favor new beginnings")
- Career archetype insights ("your chart suggests creative fields may be fulfilling")
- Relationship dynamics ("understanding this compatibility can inform your choices")
- Financial personality ("you may tend toward cautious or risk-taking financial decisions")

**Disclaimer:**
"Soul Codex provides insights for self-reflection, not legal or financial advice. Consult licensed professionals for important decisions."

---

### 5. Inclusive Language

**Principle:** Our language must respect all genders, sexual orientations, races, cultures, religions, abilities, and backgrounds.

**Why:** Soul Codex is for everyone. Exclusive or stereotypical language alienates users and perpetuates harm.

**Guidelines:**

**Gender-Inclusive:**
- Use "they/them" pronouns when gender is unknown
- Avoid gendered stereotypes (e.g., "women are emotional", "men are logical")
- Relationship language is inclusive: "partner" not "husband/wife" unless user specifies
- Human Design gates/channels: Avoid gendered interpretations (e.g., "Gate 27 isn't just about mothering—it's about nurturing in all forms")

**Sexuality-Inclusive:**
- Compatibility works for all relationship types (same-sex, polyamory, platonic)
- Don't assume romantic compatibility is only heterosexual
- Language: "partners", "relationships", not exclusively romantic

**Race & Culture-Inclusive:**
- Multiple astrological traditions (Western, Vedic, Chinese) without hierarchy
- Avoid "exotic" language for non-Western systems
- Respect cultural origins (e.g., "Vedic astrology from India", not "Indian mysticism")

**Ability-Inclusive:**
- Accessible design (screen readers, high contrast, large text options)
- Avoid ableist language ("blind to", "crazy", "dumb", "lame")
- Neurodiversity-positive (ADHD, autism, etc. are differences, not deficits)

**Examples:**

❌ **BAD (Exclusive):**
- "Women with Venus in Scorpio are jealous lovers"
- "This makes you a beta male"
- "You need to find a husband who balances your emotional nature"
- "Virgos are OCD about cleanliness"

✅ **GOOD (Inclusive):**
- "People with Venus in Scorpio often experience intense, transformative relationships"
- "This placement may bring receptivity and emotional intelligence"
- "You may find fulfillment in partnerships that provide stability and grounding"
- "Virgos often appreciate order and detail-oriented environments"

## Content Standards

### Interpretations & Reports

**Every interpretation must include:**

1. **Context:** Why this matters, how it shows up in life
2. **Nuance:** Both positive and challenging aspects (never 100% good or bad)
3. **Actionability:** What the user can do with this information
4. **Growth framing:** How this supports evolution, even if challenging

**Template:**
```
[Planet/Placement] in [Sign/House]:
- What this means: [Clear explanation without jargon]
- How this may show up: [Tendencies, not absolutes]
- Growth opportunity: [Positive framing of challenges]
- Actionable insight: [What user can do with this awareness]
```

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] No deterministic language ("you will", "always", "never")
- [ ] Empowering, not limiting
- [ ] Balanced (not only positive or only negative)
- [ ] Actionable advice included
- [ ] No medical, legal, or financial advice
- [ ] No gendered or cultural stereotypes
- [ ] Clear, jargon-free language (or jargon explained)

---

### Compatibility Reports

**Special Considerations:**
Compatibility reports can impact real relationships. Extra care required.

**Mandatory Elements:**

1. **Disclaimer at Top:**
   "Compatibility is just one lens on your relationship. Real connections require communication, effort, and mutual respect—no chart can tell you whether to stay or go."

2. **Balanced Scoring:**
   - No compatibility score below 20/100 (overly discouraging)
   - Scores 20-40: "Requires significant effort and understanding"
   - Scores 40-60: "Mixed compatibility—some harmony, some challenges"
   - Scores 60-80: "Good compatibility with some differences to navigate"
   - Scores 80-100: "Strong compatibility across most areas"

3. **Strengths First:**
   Always list relationship strengths before challenges

4. **Actionable Advice:**
   Every "challenge" includes specific advice for navigation

5. **Relationship Variety:**
   Frame compatibility for different relationship types (romantic, platonic, professional)

**Forbidden Language in Compatibility:**
- ❌ "Incompatible" (use "challenging dynamics")
- ❌ "Doomed to fail" (use "requires significant effort")
- ❌ "You should break up" (use "this awareness can inform your decisions")
- ❌ "Red flag" (use "area to discuss" or "growth opportunity")
- ❌ "Toxic" (use "unhealthy patterns that need addressing")

**Healthy Reframing:**

❌ **BAD:** "Your Moon square their Mars means constant fighting and emotional volatility. This relationship won't work."

✅ **GOOD:** "Moon square Mars can bring passionate, intense exchanges. You may experience friction between emotional needs (Moon) and action styles (Mars). With awareness, this aspect can deepen your connection—learning to honor both emotional safety and assertive expression. Consider: scheduled check-ins to discuss feelings before they escalate, active listening practices, and appreciating the passion this aspect brings."
