## Example: "Moon in Jupiter"

### ❌ BAD (What we currently do):
"Moon in Jupiter - Your emotions are expansive and optimistic."

### ✅ GOOD (User-friendly):
```
WHAT THIS MEANS:
Your Moon (your emotional nature, how you feel and respond to the world) is in Jupiter (the planet of expansion, wisdom, and optimism). 

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:
This means your emotions are naturally optimistic and expansive. When you feel good, you feel REALLY good - your happiness can feel like it fills the whole room. You have a gift for seeing the bigger picture emotionally, and you tend to trust that things will work out, even in difficult times.

HOW THIS SHOWS UP IN YOUR LIFE:
- You might find yourself naturally lifting others' spirits when they're down
- You may feel emotionally nourished by learning, travel, or spiritual practices
- Your mood tends to be generally positive, and you can bounce back from setbacks more easily than most
- You might feel emotionally connected to philosophy, higher learning, or exploring different cultures

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Jupiter is called "The Great Benefic" because it brings expansion and growth. When your emotional nature (Moon) is placed here, it means your feelings naturally align with growth, wisdom, and optimism. This is a blessing because it helps you maintain hope and see opportunities even in challenging times. However, watch out for being overly optimistic to the point of ignoring real problems, or expanding your emotions so much that you lose touch with what you actually feel.

BIRTH DATA CONNECTION:
Because the Moon was in Jupiter's sign when you were born, this emotional style is part of your fundamental nature - it's how you're wired to experience and process feelings throughout your entire life.
