VOLUME V — NUMEROLOGY

(Behavioral Drivers · Life Cycles · Repeating Signals)

⸻

SECTION 1 — HOW SOUL CODEX USES NUMEROLOGY

Before any number appears, this truth is understood:

Numbers describe how energy organizes itself over time.
They do not predict events.
They describe how experience repeats until understood.

Numerology in Soul Codex is:
•psychological
•developmental
•cross-verified with other systems

If a number does not repeat across systems, it is treated as context, not command.

When they differ → tension is explained
