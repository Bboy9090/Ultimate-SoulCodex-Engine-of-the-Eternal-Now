VOLUME IV — ASTEROIDS & FIXED STARS

(Micro-Archetypes · Subtle Destiny Tones · Zero Trivia)

---

SECTION 1 — WHY ASTEROIDS & STARS MATTER (AND WHEN THEY DON’T)

Soul Codex follows one unbreakable rule:

No symbol is included unless it adds psychological or developmental clarity.

Asteroids and fixed stars do not override planets.
They fine-tune them.

Think of them as:
•accents, not foundations
•themes, not drivers
•whispers, not commands

---

SECTION 2 — ASTEROIDS (MICRO-ARCHETYPES)

Asteroids represent specific human functions that planets are too broad to describe.

Each asteroid answers:
•What precise theme repeats in your life?
•What skill is being trained?
•Where does subtle pressure appear?
