SECTION 1 — HOW SOUL CODEX USES HUMAN DESIGN

Before any Human Design element appears, this truth is established:

Human Design does not tell you what to believe.
It describes how your body processes energy and decisions.

In Soul Codex:
•No obedience language
•No “just trust it”
•No hierarchy of types
•No spiritual superiority

Everything is framed as mechanics + awareness + choice.
