# Soul Codex Explanation Library — Volume III: Aspects

## Section 1 — How to Read Aspects in Soul Codex

Aspects describe relationships between inner functions. They are not event predictors; they reveal internal dynamics:
- how two parts of you communicate
- where energy flows easily
- where friction produces growth
- how tension becomes mastery

There are no bad aspects — only unintegrated ones.
